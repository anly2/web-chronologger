[11:41:52 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so in the begining
[11:41:58 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I introduce Andora
[11:42:06 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: marching up the Dark Elven Temple
[11:42:16 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and up the stairs being Shilen in a mortal form
[11:42:24 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Shilen offers her a special deal
[11:42:27 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: which is

[11:42:59 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: <<< First Variant
[11:43:00 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Shillen: "When your rightfull time to join me in the world of the dead comes I offer you someone to take your place instead and so granting you long life"
[11:43:01 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Andora asked cautiously "And who would that one be"
[11:43:02 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Shilen: "You will know him when you see him"
[11:43:10 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: <<< Second Variant
[11:43:11 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: - I have summoned you to grant you your well deserved reward. And if you are ready to hear it I will be glad to announce it.
[11:43:12 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Shillen stopped two steps infront of Andora who had still bowed her head low in respect.
[11:43:13 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: - I am ready, mistress.
[11:43:14 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: - Very well then. Everyone dies one day, some from old age, others earlier  in battle. I know you would never cower from a fight no matter how poor your chances might be. And so I offer you your life as something you are sure to lose earlier in battle. I will prevent your death in battle asuring you long life and death only by aging.
[11:43:20 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: - Thank you, mistress, for this is the greatest reward one could receive.
[11:43:25 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: - But there is a price that must be payed. There are no glorious battles without sacrifice and if you are to win that battle and survive there must be someone to take your place.
[11:43:30 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: - And who would be, mistress? - although afraid of the answer she still managed to ask the question that would change her life forever.
[11:43:35 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: - You will know when you see him.
[11:43:40 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart:  <<< 

[11:43:52 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Andora: "I already know, it will be the one I love. Or else it won't be an equal deal"
[11:43:57 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then she refused
[11:44:07 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: as she didn't want anyone killed because of her
[11:44:17 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then the dark elves banished her
[11:44:22 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: exiled
[11:44:24 AM] Lolli: crule
[11:44:31 AM | Edited 11:44:32 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: because she offended their goddess
[11:44:42 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and thats the first part
[11:44:43 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then
[11:44:48 AM | Edited 11:44:51 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: comes Anloal
[11:45:00 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he lives in Gludin Village

[11:45:46 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and tryes to g to her
[11:45:47 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[11:45:52 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the guards wouldnt let him
[11:46:01 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so he somehow used dark magic to teleport himself
[11:46:07 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he doesn't know how to use it
[11:46:16 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it just happens sometimes when he is in a need
[11:46:22 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and btw
[11:46:34 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal is human who practices dark magic
[11:46:34 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[11:46:42 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that is like a bad thing to do with humans
[11:46:45 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: in real
[11:46:49 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: there are dark classes
[11:46:54 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: like necros and Dark Avengers
[11:46:55 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[11:46:59 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Necros are outlaws
[11:47:00 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and
[11:47:19 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Dark avengers are people who suffered alot and seek vengence now
[11:47:20 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so
[11:47:22 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they have right
[11:47:36 AM] Lolli: i see
[11:47:38 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but necros are banished from the common towns/villages
[11:47:39 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so
[11:47:49 AM | Edited 11:47:50 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal practses dark magic
[11:47:56 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and the people dont like him because of that
[11:48:02 AM] Lolli: ok
[11:48:03 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and thats why the guards stopped him
[11:48:10 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but he managed to get to Andora
[11:48:15 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and asked her to take him with her
[11:48:16 AM] Lolli: where is she?
[11:48:19 AM] Lolli: btw?
[11:48:25 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: hiding in some shadows in that same village
[11:48:32 AM] Lolli: ok
[11:48:34 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: since she was exiled she cant go in dark elven villages
[11:48:47 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so she had hid herself in the shadows of Gludin
[11:48:55 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and Anloal found her
[11:48:58 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she asked him
[11:49:03 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: why did he want to leave
[11:49:09 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: doesn't he have friends here
[11:49:14 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: who would grief for him
[11:49:27 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and he explained he will probebly get executed because of the things he knows
