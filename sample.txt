[11:41:52 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so in the begining
[11:41:58 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I introduce Andora
[11:42:06 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: marching up the Dark Elven Temple
[11:42:16 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and up the stairs being Shilen in a mortal form
[11:42:24 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Shilen offers her a special deal
[11:42:27 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: which is

[11:42:59 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: <<< First Variant
Shillen" "When your rightfull time to join me in the world of the dead comes i offer you someone to take your place instead and so granting you long life"
Andora asked cautiously "And who would that one be"
Shilen: "You will know him when you see him"
[11:42:59 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: <<< Second Variant
- I have summoned you to grant you your well deserved reward. And if you are ready to hear it I will be glad to announce it.
	Shillen stopped two steps infront of Andora who had still bowed her head low in respect.
	- I am ready, mistress.
	- Very well then. Everyone dies one day, some from old age, others earlier in battle. I know you would never cower from a fight no matter how poor your chances might be. And so I offer you your life as something you are sure to lose earlier in battle. I will prevent your death in battle asuring you long life and death only by aging.
	- Thank you, mistress, for this is the greatest reward one could receive.
	- But there is a price that must be payed. There are no glorious battles without sacrifice and if you are to win that battle and survive there must be someone to take your place.
	- And who would be, mistress? - although afraid of the answer she still managed to ask the question that would change her life forever.
	- You will know when you see him.

[11:43:52 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Andora: "I already know, it will be the one I love. Or else it won't be an equal deal"
[11:43:57 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then she refused
[11:44:07 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: as she didn't want anyone killed because of her
[11:44:17 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then the dark elves banished her
[11:44:22 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: exiled
[11:44:26 AM] Lolli: crule
[11:44:31 AM | Edited 11:44:32 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: because she offended their goddess
[11:44:42 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and thats the first part
[11:44:43 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then
[11:44:48 AM | Edited 11:44:51 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: comes Anloal
[11:45:00 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he lives in Gludin Village

[11:45:46 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and tryes to g to her
[11:45:47 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[11:45:52 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the guards wouldnt let him
[11:46:01 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so he somehow used dark magic to teleport himself
[11:46:07 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he doesn't know how to use it
[11:46:16 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it just happens sometimes when he is in a need
[11:46:22 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and btw
[11:46:34 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal is human who practices dark magic
[11:46:34 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[11:46:42 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that is like a bad thing to do with humans
[11:46:45 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: in real
[11:46:49 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: there are dark classes
[11:46:54 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: like necros and Dark Avengers
[11:46:55 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[11:46:59 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Necros are outlaws
[11:47:00 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and
[11:47:19 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Dark avengers are people who suffered alot and seek vengence now
[11:47:20 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so
[11:47:22 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they have right
[11:47:36 AM] Lolli: i see
[11:47:38 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but necros are banished from the common towns/villages
[11:47:39 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so
[11:47:49 AM | Edited 11:47:50 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal practses dark magic
[11:47:56 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and the people dont like him because of that
[11:48:02 AM] Lolli: ok
[11:48:03 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and thats why the guards stopped him
[11:48:10 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but he managed to get to Andora
[11:48:15 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and asked her to take him with her
[11:48:16 AM] Lolli: where is she?
[11:48:19 AM] Lolli: btw?

[11:48:34 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: since she was exiled she cant go in dark elven villages
[11:48:47 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so she had hid herself in the shadows of Gludin
[11:48:55 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and Anloal found her
[11:48:58 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she asked him
[11:49:03 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: why did he want to leave
[11:49:09 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: doesn't he have friends here
[11:49:14 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: who would grief for him
[11:49:27 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and he explained he will probebly get executed because of the things he knows
[11:49:36 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the cuancil just waits for the moment
[11:49:41 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: to have him on the pole
[11:49:50 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: since Andora didn't want anyone hurt
[11:49:54 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she agreed
[11:50:06 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she was different from the ordinary dark elf
[11:50:10 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she was not cruel

[11:55:08 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and the trader
[11:55:19 AM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: told them that if they were as strong as they looked

[12:41:48 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she knew she was the only one that could convince him to go
[12:41:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: only she could save him

[12:42:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: if there was going to be a fight
[12:42:30 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal would surely die there where Khatulu would survive

[12:42:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so Andora, in her desperation
[12:42:45 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: talked bad things to Anloal
[12:42:50 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she only wanted to make him go
[12:42:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but he wouldnt go any other way

    "I can never think anything bad about you, my love. I will remember you for what you are, even if you don't feel the same anymore." - Anloal

[1:59:47 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Mos with even more epic fights
[1:59:52 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: since
[1:59:58 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the monks in mos
[2:00:15 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: were famous for that that they wouldnt let a bird fly past them
[2:00:23 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they stopped everything that intended to get in
[2:00:30 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so they had really epic fights
[2:00:37 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: in the floors up
[2:00:43 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it got even more epic
[2:00:47 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: until the last room

[2:00:52 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that
[2:01:04 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: for very long time no one could defeat the guardians

[2:02:27 PM] Lolli: hhihihi
[2:02:28 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and so was able to "lethal strike" the monk
[2:02:32 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but he knew
[2:02:37 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that if he tried to help the others
[2:02:43 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it would be useless
[2:02:44 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: since
[2:02:52 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the monks could stand their groudn against dozens
[2:03:01 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and he doupt he culd do the same with another one
[2:03:23 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: (out of soul ore, ingredient required for Banish Serpaph, the Lethal Skill to Angels)
[2:03:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so
[2:03:38 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the others told him to go on without them
[2:03:48 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: before the monk died
[2:03:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he had said something
[2:04:43 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: "In the Hands of Just the Light will bloom,
but it will be a gloomy task
for the most hurt will be
the judicator's heart.
The shadow he is and shadowy he is to be"
[2:04:52 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: sort of prophecy
[2:04:54 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: a riddle
[2:05:00 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but they ignored it
[2:05:03 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they tought
[2:05:07 PM | Edited 2:05:11 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the monk was praying to the gods
[2:05:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: in some strange prayers
[2:05:20 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so
[2:05:24 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal continued
[2:05:39 PM | Edited 2:05:42 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: There was one last really small room
[2:05:45 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but it was empty
[2:05:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it seemed strange to him
[2:05:54 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but he continued
[2:06:09 PM | Edited 2:06:11 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then I will explain the holy "traps"
[2:06:13 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: or sort

[2:06:34 PM] Lolli: how did he learn banish angels?
[2:06:38 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: from Andora
[2:06:43 PM] Lolli: thats what i thought :P
[2:06:45 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and he practiced it in woa with you
[2:06:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: :)
[2:06:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so
[2:07:02 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: after he passes the traps
[2:07:09 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he opens the doors
[2:07:13 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: leading to the grail room
[2:07:21 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but they seemed to be unlocked
[2:07:26 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it was very strange
[2:07:30 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and then he found out why
[2:07:53 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: a grinning (smiling evelly) dark elf
[2:08:02 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: stood in the center with the grail in hands
[2:08:08 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal and the elf
[2:08:08 PM] Lolli: ow

[2:08:19 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: how he looked for him
[2:08:26 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and that
[2:08:37 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Andora was with him
[2:08:42 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he seemed to want to anger Anloal
[2:08:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal found out
[2:08:52 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that
[2:09:03 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that same dark elf was the one that had hunted Andora
[2:09:09 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he wanted so much to kill him
[2:09:09 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[2:09:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: an invisible wall was raised infront of him
[2:09:22 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he couldnt go forth
[2:09:24 PM] Lolli: ah
[2:09:24 PM] Lolli: so
[2:09:28 PM] Lolli: he was one of them

[2:10:17 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: having enough talk
[2:10:24 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the Dark elf took out a soe
[2:10:25 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and
[2:10:33 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: started chanting
[2:10:37 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: just then
[2:10:42 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal managed to break the wall
[2:10:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and jumped for the dark elf
[2:10:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: unfortunatelly
[2:11:00 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he was too late
[2:11:04 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he only managed to grasp

[2:11:15 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: hanging from the elf's belt
[2:11:20 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and then the elf dissapeared
[2:11:29 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he lay disappointed on the ground
[2:11:35 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he tought how he had failed the entire world
[2:11:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and that now
[2:11:45 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Andora was going to suffer most
[2:11:54 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: in tears
[2:11:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he opened the bag
[2:12:01 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: inside
[2:12:05 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: were two scrolls
[2:12:11 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: one was a scribble
[2:12:21 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: of things about the grail
[2:12:26 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it looked so much
[2:12:26 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: like
[2:12:32 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Andora's handwriting
[2:12:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but he couldnt explain how it could be
[2:12:49 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he guessed the dark elf must write the same as Andora
[2:12:53 PM | Edited 2:12:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: in that scroll
[2:13:00 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: was explained all about the grail

[2:13:30 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it wasnt an ordinary one
[2:13:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it was a soe to an exact location
[2:13:52 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: whereas the normal soe would teleport you to the nearest town gatekeeper
[2:13:59 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: this would teleport you to a curtain one
[2:14:04 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: no matter what town was the nearest

[2:18:13 PM | Edited 2:18:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so that when he used it
[2:18:23 PM] Lolli: brb wc
[2:18:24 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it would kill him and deal with him
[2:18:25 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: ok
[2:21:31 PM] Lolli: baack
[2:22:02 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so Anloal decided he shouldn't use the dark elf's scroll

He had a soe of his own and though it would get him in Rune he could easily teleprt to Hardin's from there

So he used his own soe and got to Rune

He went to his friend's House (Clan Hall) and he got the stuff he needed for the trip, weaps pots and so on

He also left the scrobble and a note to let his friends know where he was

it was stupid to go on your own to a man you dont know how dangerous might be, but there was no time, the elf needed to be stopped or else he would master the grail's magic and then become unstopable
[2:22:06 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: :D

[2:26:31 PM | Edited 2:26:34 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: in Aden
[2:26:44 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he told him
[2:26:44 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that
[2:26:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he must gather an army
[2:26:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and help him hunt the dark elf
[2:27:12 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he described the dark elf so that Lorenz (you) would know who to hunt
[2:27:20 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and then said that
[2:27:24 PM] Lolli: :)
[2:27:35 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: if he was not back in a month (the time Lorenz would need to gather an army)
[2:27:45 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Lorenz should attack and find that dark elf
[2:27:47 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: without him
[2:27:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so having said all
[2:27:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal went
[2:28:03 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: to Hardin's
[2:28:07 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: When there
[2:28:17 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he was stunned by it
[2:28:21 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the size of the cave
[2:28:24 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: its red glow
[2:28:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and the dragon ribs that stood out of the rock
[2:28:49 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and the ugly smell it had
[2:28:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it all disgusted him
[2:28:59 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but he knew he had to go in
[2:29:04 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he was furious
[2:29:09 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he wanted so much to kill the elf
[2:29:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: not only because he had the grail now
[2:29:25 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but because he talked bad things about Andora
[2:29:28 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he was going to pay
[2:29:36 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: with those furious intentions
[2:29:40 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he proceeded in
[2:29:50 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: sec the guests are leaving

[2:47:20 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so Anloal started walking inside the4 cave
[2:47:23 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: very agnry
[2:47:26 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: at the dark elf
[2:47:29 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[2:47:35 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: just as he made the first step in
[2:47:40 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: immence pain took him over
[2:47:45 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: his vision blured
[2:47:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he couldn't hear
[2:48:01 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the pain was so intense
[2:48:10 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he could no longer stand on his feet
[2:48:14 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he fell unconsciousness
[2:48:43 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then Hardin himself came to see who had come wishing to desturb him
[2:48:53 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he saw it was a human
[2:48:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and that he was still alive
[2:49:01 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: incredible
[2:49:14 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: no one ever survived the protective spell
[2:49:22 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: if anyone was to come here with bad intentions
[2:49:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the spell was going to kill him
[2:49:36 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but this one had survived
[2:49:44 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he didn't know what to do with him
[2:49:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he didnt want to keep him at his place
[2:49:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so
[2:50:10 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he asked his guest to take him
[2:50:14 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the guest
[2:50:15 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: was
[2:50:18 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: as you can guess
[2:50:24 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the Dark elf High Tetrach
[2:50:31 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the elf agreed
[2:50:44 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he gave Anloal to his torturers
[2:50:51 PM] Lolli: ow
[2:50:54 PM] Lolli: fail
[2:50:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: ye
[2:51:01 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they tortured him
[2:51:04 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and tortured him
[2:51:12 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: until he could no longer stand the pain
[2:51:15 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then he died
[2:51:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[2:51:19 PM] Lolli: oh^^
[2:51:19 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the torturers
[2:51:23 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: resurected him
[2:51:25 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: again and again
[2:51:29 PM] Lolli: omg
[2:51:31 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and continued tortureing him
[2:51:33 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it was endless
[2:51:42 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: hopless beyon any comprehension
[2:52:01 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: ressurection was possible within short amount of time from the death
[2:52:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: one day
[2:52:25 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal woke in a different place
[2:52:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it was all dark
[2:52:31 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: with dark walls
[2:52:35 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and there was almost no light
[2:52:48 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the only light that was in the room came from the distand coridor
[2:52:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then he remembered who had him
[2:52:59 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: dark elves
[2:53:01 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he guessed
[2:53:07 PM | Edited 2:53:22 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: this must be the Temple of Shilen
[2:53:15 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: where they would torture him even more
[2:53:31 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he kinda got used to the pain
[2:53:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but everytime
[2:53:43 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it got stronger
[2:53:46 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he wondered
[2:53:49 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: when will be t
[2:53:50 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that
[2:53:58 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he would die from the first painful touch
[2:54:08 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: when would the pain become that strong
[2:54:13 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but he wasnt afraid of the pain
[2:54:17 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he was more afraid
[2:54:20 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: of being crippled
[2:54:25 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: disabled for life
[2:54:33 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: what would he do if he couldnt see Andora again
[2:54:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: or couldn't hear her voice
[2:54:48 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he would rather die than live such a invalid life
[2:54:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: fortunately for him
[2:55:13 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he was as able to hear, see, feel and so on as the first day they got him
[2:55:24 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the torturers only caused him pain but didnt cripple him
[2:55:28 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and he was glad for that
[2:55:35 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: one day
[2:55:45 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the he heard the torturers talk
[2:55:49 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he had heard them often
[2:55:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: discussing their master's plan
[2:56:05 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they felt secure and sure that his prisonor wont escape
[2:56:09 PM | Edited 2:56:12 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so they talked freely
[2:56:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but this time
[2:56:22 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he heard them that their master is leaving
[2:56:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: for a catacombs or some sort
[2:56:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they said he would return more powerfull than Baium
[2:56:47 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and reward them for their struggles
[2:56:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: That very same day
[2:57:18 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal's friends stormed the temple
[2:57:28 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Nevermore, deyneste....
[2:57:44 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they drew the attention and almost all guards went to the gates to stop them
[2:57:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that left Anloal alone
[2:58:13 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he had saved some things with which he could open the door
[2:58:23 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but he doupt that even if he opened it he could escape
[2:58:25 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: now
[2:58:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he could
[2:58:28 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so
[2:58:33 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he opened the dungeon door
[2:58:44 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and wento to see who was causing that trouble
[2:58:52 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he soon saw the familiar faces
[2:58:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and without any questions
[2:59:03 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: jumped in the fight
[2:59:07 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: when all had finished
[2:59:11 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he only said
[2:59:15 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: "What took you so long"
[2:59:17 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: in real
[2:59:24 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he had lost sence of time long ago
[2:59:34 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he didnt know for how long he was held captive of the dark elves
[3:00:03 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: his friends told him he was missing for more than a month now and they had been looking for him a long time
[3:00:08 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they had found where he is
[3:00:08 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[3:00:17 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they waited until now for the righ moment
[3:00:21 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the temple was well guarded
[3:00:22 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but now
[3:00:29 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: with the confusion of the master leasving
[3:00:34 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they had the chance
[3:00:38 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and used it
[3:00:52 PM] Lolli: now
[3:00:54 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal told them what he had heard

[3:01:25 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: to help Anloal defeat the dark elf

[3:01:37 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: ye

[3:01:50 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: its kinda strange
[3:01:50 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: cause
[3:01:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: we defeat it without the army
[3:01:59 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so
[3:02:01 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: let me continue
[3:02:15 PM | Edited 3:02:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal told his friends what he had heard from his captors
[3:02:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that the master was going for some catacombs
[3:02:35 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they told him the nearest catacombs were
[3:02:41 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the catacombs of dark omens
[3:02:52 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and that above all they were the most dangerous ones
[3:03:00 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but they had to go there
[3:03:12 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal told them the dark elf porebly seeked even more power
[3:03:21 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and with the use of the grail he could easily get it
[3:03:25 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they must stop him
[3:03:38 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the next day they spent in traveling
[3:03:46 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they went round the dark elven village
[3:03:54 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: as the catacombs were to the west past it
[3:04:06 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they traveled through the garden of Shilen
[3:04:22 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: because they couldnt go through the enemy's stronghold
[3:04:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: anyway
[3:04:31 PM] Lolli: 1 mom
[3:04:34 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it was not much of a delay afterall
[3:04:35 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: yes?
[3:04:39 PM] Lolli: calling dosto
[3:04:48 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: kk
[3:04:53 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: tell me when to continue
[3:06:31 PM] Lolli: heheh
[3:06:35 PM | Edited 3:06:51 PM] Lolli: forced him to something
[3:06:38 PM] Lolli: ok go on
[3:06:44 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart:     with only a little delay they were at the catacombs' entrance.
    The catacombs themselves were a vast labyrinth which's end was legendary. Some said Lilith other Anakim resided there, third claimed there was a portal through no one had gone. In any case it held power which a dark elf with already enough power could claim for himself. They had to stop him.
[3:07:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart:     Fortunately every necromancer was to study the catacombs' and necropolises' maps. Equuleus knew the way to the end so they simply regrouped and with the punch force of a crazed bull they swept through rooms and coridors until they reached the end.
[3:07:47 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: As the dark elf was alone he had to progress much slower than them. So in the end they catch up with him and in an epic fight (as he had the powers from the grail) he was defeated. The group of deadly friends decided they were not to open the last door. They neither had the power of the dark elf nor his lust for power
[3:08:18 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart:     They had to get the Grail back to its rightfull place. Anloal asked them to carry on without him because he wanted to see someone. They agreed but then they found out none of them can carry the grail, it caused immence pain to whoever holds it. Then Suzan remembered the words of the only monk that fell in the last room - the one that Anloal defeated.
[3:08:59 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: "In the hands of just the light will bloom
 but it will be a gloomy task
 for the most hurt will be
 the judicator's heart.
 The shadow he is and shadowy he is to be. "
[3:09:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Suzan had finally understood the meaning. Through great pain she handed him over the grail. He hurried to take it off her so not to hurt her. And then the grail glowed with fascinating light. It bathed all in divine illuminations
[3:09:46 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: you manage to read it or i write it too fast?
[3:09:51 PM | Edited 3:10:10 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: i mean I copy it now

But I failed. I wished so much to prove you I could be like you, seeking justice above all, but it seems I can't"
[3:45:40 PM | Edited 3:45:53 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart:     "I'm so sorry... I should NOT have stopped talking, I should have told you before you even thought of killing yourself. I'm sorry... Please forgive me..." and he fell over him in cries.

[8:26:03 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the night sentinels stood their ground
[8:26:15 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they could easily kill a bigger army on their own
[8:26:20 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the undead were much more of a fight
[8:26:31 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: those soldiers were not willing to listen to Anloal
[8:26:34 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and so were weak
[8:26:44 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they killed most of the soldiers
[8:26:49 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and when there were so few left
[8:26:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they stopped
[8:26:59 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and asked for forgivness
[8:27:04 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal granted it

[8:27:47 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: (and later proved it)
[8:27:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he will still lose since he cant fight the undead alone
[8:27:58 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but
[8:28:03 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: before the solders attacked
[8:28:12 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal had secretly asked something Unfamia

[8:39:36 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and so
[8:39:40 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he made a plan
[8:39:42 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: to buy them time

[9:09:29 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I loved her so much
[9:09:47 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that when I found out she was doing the test to become a Shilen Knight
[9:10:09 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I told my Tetrachs to think of a better reward for her
[9:10:19 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they even consulted
[9:10:21 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Shilen herself
[9:10:38 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and she had a deal
[9:10:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she offered
[9:11:19 PM | Edited 9:11:22 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: "When your Rightfull place to join me in the underworld comes, I offer you one that will take your place"
[9:11:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: you remember the wicked deal
[9:11:36 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so thifiel continoues
[9:11:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I didnt know what the reward was
[9:12:02 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: until the time to tell her came
[9:12:10 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: my tetrachs wanted it to be a surprise
[9:12:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and it was quite a surpirse
[9:12:23 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: At first
[9:12:28 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I was so happy for her
[9:12:33 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that she would live so long
[9:12:43 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but then she cautiously asked
[9:12:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: "And who would that one be?"
[9:13:10 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Shilen replied that she would now when she saw him
[9:13:21 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: "I already know
[9:13:35 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: it will be the one I love, or else it wont be a good deal for you"
[9:13:48 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: "I refuse" Andora said
[9:13:56 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the Tetrachs were stunned
[9:14:12 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they couldnt understand how someone could refuse Shilen's Offer
[9:14:20 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they were angry
[9:14:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that they had sacrificed so much for that deal
[9:14:31 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and not she refused
[9:14:38 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they wanted her banished
[9:14:44 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but only I could order that
[9:14:47 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and yet
[9:14:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: through all my love
[9:15:04 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I couldnt disobey the wishes of my people
[9:15:07 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I had to banish her
[9:15:12 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and so did I
[9:15:19 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but then
[9:15:24 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I negotiated hard
[9:15:36 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and conviced the tetrachs that she hadn't done such a bad thing
[9:15:45 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I asked them to forgive her
[9:15:55 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: after some time they agreed
[9:16:09 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then I wished nothing else than to find Andora and make her my Queen as she would be
[9:16:19 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but she ran from my messengers
[9:16:23 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she found you
[9:16:27 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and with your help escaped
[9:17:01 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I knew as unexperienced as they might have been that the men that attacked you in death's pass were going to have her if it wasnt for you

[9:18:19 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: after some long time
[9:18:41 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: someone, I dont remember who, reported that you and Andora were in Aden
[9:18:58 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: then I ordered my general <name> to go get Andora

[9:21:08 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: you were originally a human so it couldnt have been you
[9:21:22 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but little did I know that you would be so troublesome for my plans
[9:21:33 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the general said
[9:21:50 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: he had arrainged an "accident" for the one that helped Andora
[9:22:09 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but I didnt hear anything from the snet party afterwards
[9:22:14 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I didnt care
[9:22:19 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Andora was with me
[9:22:22 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: i wanted nothing else

[9:23:09 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: i decided I need to make her forget you
[9:23:25 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so I went to get the only source of power I knew might work
[9:23:31 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the grail
[9:23:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and then I saw you for the first time

[9:25:19 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: I knew that Andora was visiting you regularly
[9:25:32 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but I thought you would tell her things
[9:25:35 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so I let her go
[9:25:41 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but imagine how surprised I was
[9:25:54 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: when i found out that she never came to you personally
[9:25:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: that you never saw her
[9:26:06 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: i became really angry
[9:26:15 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and since I couldnt manage to use the grail
[9:26:28 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: i needed another source of power to make her forget about you
[9:26:33 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Lilith's power
[9:26:43 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the power of a night nymph
[9:26:49 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the pwoers over dreams
[9:26:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and night itself
[9:27:03 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: i hoped that with the power of the grail I could take it

[9:58:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they said that the Night Sentinels as whole brought the war, they would bring it again
[9:58:58 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so they wanted them burned
[9:59:21 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal, as a ghost, told Andora she cant bring them to reason
[9:59:24 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she was to leave them
[9:59:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: She asked where were they to go
[9:59:58 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the general seemed surprised since they couldnt hear Anloal
[10:00:06 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and they tought Andora was speaking to her self
[10:00:09 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they laughed
[10:00:31 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal said that the Night Sentinels could live in the Immmortal peninsula
[10:00:34 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: (orc territory)
[10:00:48 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and told her she must leave that very moment
[10:00:59 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: before the generals became angry enough to attack
[10:01:06 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she agreed with him
[10:01:33 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Infamia - the supportative master of the Night Sentinels
[10:01:39 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: instantly teleported them
[10:01:41 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: to Giran
[10:01:48 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: from there
[10:01:56 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they had time to get to the peninsula
[10:02:09 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: before the army catched them
[10:02:15 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: quite unfortunately
[10:02:21 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the gatekeepers were no more
[10:02:29 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they were slain in the undead invasion
[10:02:32 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: so they had to walk
[10:02:42 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: they travelled through day and night
[10:02:57 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and managed to stay ahead
[10:03:07 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: but when they reached the Immortal Peninsula
[10:03:16 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: the Army was right behind them
[10:03:30 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: she couldnt understand how they were faster then few men

[10:07:32 PM | Edited 10:07:34 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: "As long as you live we will hunt you"
[10:07:36 PM | Edited 10:07:45 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: Anloal: You cant hunt what you cant see
[10:07:51 PM] [NS] Anloal Nightheart: and he chanted some strange words
